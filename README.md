## Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
### Part I - 

### Part II - 

### Part III - Flask App
Utilized Flask app to connect MongoDB with different Tesla models to show the popularity of supercharger cars.
Get general information (make, model, price, and images) of Tesla models by web-scraping off of Carvanas
Generated Tesla Scraper html to display above data in one single  

## Requirements
* Your visualization must include a Python Flaskâ€“powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
* Your project should fall into one of the below three tracks: 
    * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly 
    * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data 
    * A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved) 
* Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover. 
* Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records. 
* Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes). 
* Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
